#### go2rtc
go2rtc is a lightweight, open-source streaming server designed for real-time video and audio streaming.

We are using it to read a stream in h265, manipulate and publish it so chrome could read and play it.

Run it with the docker compose provided (docker-compose up)

Config can be changed from go2rtc.yaml (in volum to your config file path) or from the web GUI in http://localhost:1984
